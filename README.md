# Constraint Satisfaction AI Project
This project implements Forward Checking and Generalized Arc Consistency (GAC) constraint propagators, alongside Minimum-Remaining-Value (MRV) and Degree heuristics. Additionally, it implements three CSP models, including two grid-only Cagey models and a full Cagey puzzle model incorporating cage constraints.
